            Intelligence at Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology (VJIT),
            Hyderabad (2021‚Äì2025). This academic journey has equipped me
            with a strong foundation in modern technologies like machine
            learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and
            full-stack development.

        Beyond academics, my time at VJIT has been filled with valuable memories‚Äîfrom participating in national-level hackathons, cloud computing workshops, and IoT bootcamps to collaborating with peers on innovative projects. These experiences helped sharpen my problem-solving abilities and team collaboration skills. I've also taken part in college events and tech fests that encouraged creativity and leadership.</i></p>
